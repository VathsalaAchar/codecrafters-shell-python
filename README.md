This is a starting point for Python solutions to the
["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview).

In this challenge, I'm building my own POSIX compliant shell that's capable of
interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like
cd, pwd, echo and more. I'm keen to learn about shell command parsing,
REPLs, builtin commands, and more.

I've added the Navigation and Quoting extensions. I'll work on adding Redirection next.

A lot of the features can be completed using `shlex` python library but I have 
attempted without it. The code is more verbose, but my understanding of how a shell 
parses commands has improved especially with quoting in the mix.
